Won't say no

He's got sugar on his lips
And he knows that the sickness is his
And he shows it, he just shows it

He'll give you the remedy without the chemical
Show you the picture without the scenery

All he wants is
Blow by blow by blow accounts
Always searching for the real thing
Scratching the surface, getting nowhere

My place has been stolen invaded by sharks
Covered in gutter, as shiny as glass
Universe's something sweet
Galaxy is sweet

Won't say no, it won't say yes
Won't say no, it won't say yes

Crush me with your ice pick, I am the queen
I've come to take the sweetness
And keep you down in my cave

The pavement is soft and sweet
The galaxy is so elite

Won't say no, it won't say yes
Won't say no, it won't say yes

Won't say no (everybody knows)
It won't say yes (I've seen it with my eyes)

Won't say no (everybody knows)
It won't say yes (I've seen it with my eyes)
